  <h1> This is my transcription from Knox's Secound Tract</h1>
  <p> If however purchasing Negros for Slavesbe consistent with divine and human obligations, care should be taken to secure the property of the slave to his owner under all circumstances.</p>
  <p> and such a plan of instruction should be digested, as might best conduce to the Negroes eternal welfare, without making them uneasy in thier present condition or encouragining them to revolt against thier owners.</p>
  <p> As the first thing to be done therefore is to determine the lawfulnes of purchasing Negors for slaves, it may be proper to state the fact fully, that those whose high office it is expounded the divine will as far as it has been reveald.</p>
  <p> May be the better able to judge of the conformity or repugnance of this transaction to it.</P>
