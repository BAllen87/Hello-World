  <h1> Thomas R.R. Cobb secessionist</h1>
  <p> First. This Constitution was made for white menâ€”citizens of the United States; this Union was formed by white men, and for the protection and happiness of their race. It is true, that the framers gave to each State the power to declare who should be electors at the ballot-box in each State. </p>
  <p> and such a plan of instruction should be digested, as might best conduce to the Negroes eternal welfare, without making them uneasy in thier present condition or encouragining them to revolt against thier owners.</p>
  <p> As the first thing to be done therefore is to determine the lawfulnes of purchasing Negors for slaves, it may be proper to state the fact fully, that those whose high office it is expounded the divine will as far as it has been reveald.</p>
  <p> May be the better able to judge of the conformity or repugnance of this transaction to it.</P>
